## üéØ Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop an RL agent capable of performing in continuous action spaces. The agent is trained using policy-based methods to maximize cumulative rewards in simulated environments.

### Key Features

- **Environment Interaction**: Utilizes OpenAI Gym environments for simulation.
- **Policy Learning**: Implements algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for stable learning.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Includes tools for monitoring training progress and evaluating agent performance.
