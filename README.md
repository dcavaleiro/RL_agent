# ü§ñ RL_agent: Reinforcement Learning Agent for Continuous Control

This project implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent designed to solve continuous control tasks. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the agent learns optimal policies through interaction with dynamic environments. The goal of this RL agent is to be capable of solving an environment for decision-making in Autonomous Driving.
